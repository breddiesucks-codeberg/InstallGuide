# InstallGuide
huh wha, get out

I am making this repo as a little ledger where I can note down my little patches and installations to build a functional workflow. And since I use artix instead of arch (and I thought of shifting to Gentoo :P), driver and software availability is restricted. Hence this little cute journal

1. Install the damn system (future gentoo install on a vm will contain all the little bits)
2. libvirt
3. emacs, git and toolchains (ghci, clisp/sbcl, rustup)
4. mpd / cmus
